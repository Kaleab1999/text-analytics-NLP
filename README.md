In this repository, you can get basic text preprocessing steps:
1. case normalization: change cases of the words to lower case. e.g. Student-> student
2. extract contractions: expand shorthand words to full format. e.g. don't-> do not
3. remove numbers, punctations, emojis. e.g. student2-> student
4. remove stop words: stop words are words that occur frequently and employ less sentiment. e.g. or,a, an, the, ...
5. stemming: changing the words to their root word (to reduce vocabulary size)
6. victorizing: changes texts to vectors in order to train the model.
7. apply machine learning model
